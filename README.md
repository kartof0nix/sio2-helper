# Sio2-helper

## What it does ##

This is a concatination of tools that improve sio2 experience.

It is compatible with all versions of sio2 that I am aware of (see Tested Sio2 Versions paragraph) , however if you find a bug, please create an Issue.

### List of all features:
1. Score hiding - useful for creating virtual contests.
2. Vertical ranking sum (points per task) - allows you to clasify the difficulty of tasks.
3. Score revealing (UNAVAILABLE).
 
# Usage
All controls are in upper-right extension menu. You can't use the extension on built-in browser websites.

### 1. Score hiding 

This is pretty intuitional : you just flip the switch and all final scores are now invisible.

### 2. Ranking sum.

Enter a ranking page and click 'Sum Ranking' button in the extension menu.

### 3. Score revealing.

First, remember to turn on score hiding before entering sio2 in order not to spoil the scores. Then, enter the appropriate contest on sio2. Once you enter the 'Problems' / 'Zadania' subpage, you will be able to see how many problems are rated. Then, click 'Score Reveal' in the menu.



## Beta release
