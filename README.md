## What it does ##

The extension includes:
* A background script to hide page before the extension loads
* a browser action with a popup including HTML, CSS, and JS
* a content script

When the user clicks the browser action button, the popup is shown, enabling
the user to choose wheter to hide points or not


When the user chooses to hide points, all score-related items should be deleted.

Refreshing the page should keep the settings unchanged.
