# Sio-helper

## What it does ##

This is a concatination of all tools I have written for sio2.

However, the most developed feature as of now is score revealing.

### List of all features:
1. Score hiding ( for virtual contests)
2. Vertical ranking sum ( points per task)
3. Score revealing.
 
# Usage
All controls are in upper-right extension menu. You can't use the extension on built-in websites.

### 1. Score hiding 

This is pretty intuitional : you just flip on a switch and all scores are now invisible.

### 2. Ranking sum.

Enter a ranking page and click 'Sum Ranking'

### 3. Score revealing.

First, remember to turn on score hiding before entering sio2 in order not to spoil the scores. Then, enter the appropriate contest on sio2. Once you enter the 'Problems' / 'Zadania' subpage, you will be able to see how many problems are rated (only submitted problems count). If satisfactory, click 'Score Reveal'.



## Beta release
This is an in-production work. Some features ( like editting revealing presets ) are not yet implemented. Bugs are expected. This version only works for Firefox and Safari browsers ( only tested on firefox).

## Installation

1. Go to the latest release : https://github.com/kartof0nix/sio2-helper/releases/latest
2. Download the .xpi file

If your browser hasn't installed the extension already:
1. Go to Manage Extensions
2. Click settings icon
3. Click 'Install add-on from file'
4. Select the .xpi file.
